# **Quantum-Delta-Encoding**

This repository contains the code associated with our paper submitted to *Euro-Par 2025*.

## 📁 **Repository Structure**

### `QDE_case/`
Provides a detailed quantum circuit construction and simulation results for the first simple case discussed in the paper.

### `QDE_color_case/`
Contains the implementation of Quantum Delta Encoding (QDE) for image processing experiments, including detailed quantum circuit construction and simulation results.

### `Noise_QDE_all_qubit/`
Performs a complete noise analysis on a single QDE quantum state. To analyze specific qubits, simply modify the indices of the affected qubits.

### `Noise_compared/`
Provides noise-resistance comparisons between QDE, MQIR, and PE-NGQR, along with visualized results.

For details on the quantum circuit constructions, please refer to the corresponding references in the paper.

## 📊 **Datasets and Results**

Additionally, we include:

- The real datasets used in the paper.
