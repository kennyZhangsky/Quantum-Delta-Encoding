# Quantum-Delta-Encoding
This repository contains the code associated with our paper submitted to Euro-Par 2025.

QDE_case: Provides a detailed quantum circuit construction and simulation results for the first simple case discussed in the paper.
QDE_color_case: Contains the implementation of QDE for image processing experiments, including detailed quantum circuit construction and simulation results.
Noise_QDE_all_qubit: Performs a complete noise analysis on a single QDE quantum state. To analyze specific qubits, simply modify the indices of the affected qubits.
Noise_compared: Provides noise-resistance comparisons between QDE, MQIR, and PE-NGQR, along with visualized results.
For details on the quantum circuit constructions, please refer to the corresponding references.

Additionally, we include the real datasets used in the paper, as well as the data obtained from IBM's superconducting quantum computers. All experimental results are fully reproducible.
